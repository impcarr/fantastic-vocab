todos:

refine the punctuation stripper, right now it's definitely doing an overzealous job.

get numbers out of there?

figure out how best to get titles for each table

make a schema for each type of table - book by book, and then total corpus?

make a method for updating aggregate table whenever I want to add new books

standardize on snake case (see if there's a linter)

think about doing some proper nlp standardization - tokens rather than words, stop words, etc.
